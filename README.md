Collection of small projects as I learn to code in Python â€” inspirations and guidelines from Youtube, Daily Python Projects, ChatGPT, and Claude.

Some fun ones in the python-practice branch:
  1. Slot Machine
  2. Recipe Finder
  3. Simple ATM
  4. Motivational Quote of the Day (featuring Claude's 'Ironic Motivational Quotes for the Lazy')

Goal projects for end of 2024 (and writing this out will help me commit):
  1. Magic 8-ball
  2. Wine fridge organiser (might be a stretch for EOY, maybe Jan 2025)

Future projects using other languages & frameworks:
  - GBBO bracket (for next season)
  - AR art and picture hanging tool
